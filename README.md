<h2>Why Snake?</h2>



<p>For our Module 1 project we were given the task to build a game using the skills we have learned so far. I had decided on Snake as it was a game I was familiar with and used to play alot on my mom's Nokia 3310. I built my game to give off a <em>retro 8-bit arcade/cyberpunk-hackeresque</em> theme stylized it as such.</p>

<h2>My Approach</h2>

<p>At first I tried building the game objects before the game itself using classes however, I ultimately decided to building a game object that would contain all the methods I would need to run the game without fear of hoisting or over complicating a function.</p>

<h4>Mobile Friendly</h4>

<p>I used media queries to make the game available to play on mobile devices as well. Using buttons to control the direction of the snake where a keyboard input would be absent.</p>

<h4>Win States</h4>
<p>There is only one win state in the game which is to reach the score of <strong>3100</strong> points. There are however six levels in each level the speed increases making the game more difficult, the sixth being the final level.</p>

<h4>Lose States</h4>
<p>There are only two lose states, the first in which the snake collides with the canvas edge, the second in which the snake touches it's own body.</p>



<h4>Technologies</h4>

    <li>FlexBox</li>
