<h2>Why Snake?</h2>



<p>For our Module 1 project we were given the task to build a game using the skills we have learned so far. I had decided on Snake as it was a game I was familiar with and used to play alot on my mom's Nokia 3310. I built my game to give off a retro 8-bit arcade like theme stylized it as such.</p>

<h2>My Approach</h2>

<p>At first I tried building the game objects before the game itself using classes however, I ultimately decided to building a game object that would contain all the methods I would need to run the game without fear of hoisting or over complicating a function.</p>

<h4>Technologies</h4>
<ul>
    <li>FlexBox</li>
    <li>Canvas API</li>
    <li>Vanilla JS</li>
</ul>

<h4>Unsolved Problems</h4>
<p>I have been trying to impliment a functioning restart button but have yet to find a solution.</p>
